#### By _**Chris Turina**_

## Description

_This app is a public blog site where other people can look at workouts other people have posted.  The user is directed to the welcome page and then selects categories and can click on a couple of different categories to see what workouts other people have posted.  There is an admin section that lets the administrator create categories and also delete categories.  This application is using firebase so everything that is added or deleted is in the administrators firebase account._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

*_ The user must have angular cli installed, atom text editor, and access to the internet.

*_ The user first needs to create a firebase account by googling firebase and login with there google account.  Then they press the get started button on the page.  Next add a project.  Then click the 'add firebase to your web app'.  Take all that information and hold onto it because we will be using it soon.

*_ In the console go to the desktop and git clone the this repo
*_ Create an api-keys.ts in the app folder
*_ take the information from before and put it in the api-keys folder, then add the folder to the gitignore file so no one can take your information.
*_ in the console type: npm install
*_ then type: ng serve
*_open the browser window and paste the url the console gave you (its usually https:localhost:4200)
*_ Enjoy the application
